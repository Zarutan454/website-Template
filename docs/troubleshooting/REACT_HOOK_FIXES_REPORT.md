# React Hook Fixes Report

## Issue Summary
The BSN website was experiencing critical React hook errors that prevented proper functionality:

```
Warning: Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component.
TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useState')
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The errors were caused by:
1. **Import Issues**: The `useIntersectionObserver` hook was being imported from `../../utils/useIntersectionObserver` but had compatibility issues with the current React context
2. **Hook Context Problems**: React hooks were returning `null` instead of proper state values, indicating a React context initialization problem
3. **Multiple React Instances**: Potential conflicts in the dependency tree (resolved - all React versions properly deduped to 18.3.1)

## Components Affected
The following components were experiencing React hook errors:
- `src/components/animations/GlowingParticles.jsx`
- `src/components/animations/HexagonGrid.jsx`
- `src/components/animations/DataFlowAnimation.jsx`

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Inline Hook Implementation
Instead of importing the problematic `useIntersectionObserver` hook, we implemented inline versions in each affected component with comprehensive error handling and fallbacks.

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
Added comprehensive fallback mechanisms:
- **IntersectionObserver Support Check**: Graceful degradation for browsers without IntersectionObserver support
- **Element Validation**: Proper null checks for DOM elements
- **Fallback Visibility**: Assumes elements are visible if observation fails

### 3. Improved Ref Handling
Enhanced ref assignment to prevent null reference errors with proper conditional checks.

### 4. Cache Cleanup
Performed comprehensive cache cleanup to resolve any stale development artifacts:
- Cleared Vite cache (`node_modules/.vite`)
- Cleared build artifacts (`dist`)
- Cleaned npm cache
- Restarted development server
